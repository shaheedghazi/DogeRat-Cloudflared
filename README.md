# Fork - Modded Start.sh and Port.sh
This repository contains a modified version of start.sh and port.sh scripts, designed to enhance the functionality of your project setup. The modifications include the integration of Cloudflared's Quick Tunnel instead of Serveo, as well as the removal of slow-loading banners for improved performance.

### Please note that before running these scripts, you need to install Cloudflared.
